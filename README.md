# Multimatics Development

## Getting Started

We assume you have docker and vscode installed on your machine. If not, please install docker by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and vscode by following the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

First, clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruhyadi/multimatics
```

Then, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd multimatics
code .
```

Next, press `CTRL + SHIFT + P` and type `Dev Container: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`. This will build the docker container and open the project in a containerized environment.
